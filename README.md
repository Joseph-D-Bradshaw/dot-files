My dotfiles

Ensure you change change the directory name to just "nvim" and place in ~/.config/

## Current
This is my goto that I want to make the universal Nvim experience, use this one (just called nvim)

### Special instructions:
packer should auto install itself
You will possibly need to run PackerCompile yourself



## Mac
nvim is cleaner and more recent, may not work on Linux. Yet to test

## Linux
Note, :CocInstall is used with nvim
coc-json, coc-python and other coc packages may need to be installed from within nvim itself
